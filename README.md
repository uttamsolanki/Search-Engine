# Search-Engine
Build web search engine application in JAVA. This application contains 10,000 HTML Pages.From 10,000 Pages, its find  page name which have more frequently word searched by user. 

To developed this application, I used different data structures like Heap Data structure for page ranking, trie data structure for word suggestion.

Moreover, I used HashMap,TreeMap and Merge sort Algorithm for sorting.
